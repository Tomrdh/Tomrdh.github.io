                <h2 class="text-blue">So you want to know <i>everything</i> about me?</h2>
                <p>Maybe avoid to be too curious lol. Obviously, I'm limited to put only <i>public</i> things here. But let's introduce myself now.</p>
                <h2 class="text-blue" id="primary-life">General - Primary life</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name: Tom (hehe, who didn't guessed it?)</li>
                    <li>Family name: In your dreams.</li>
                    <li>Age: If you really want to know, I was born in 2005.</li>
                    <li>Gender: Male</li>
                    <li>Occupation: I'm still a student.</li>
                    <li>Country: France</li>
                    <li>See my face and my voice in video: This is a private video, then IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT KIND OF CONTENT, then… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">click here</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-blue" id="secondary-life">Secondary life</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am almost ALWAYS on my computer, particularly on Discord. I love that.</li>
                    <li>What I do on my PC: Talking on Discord, watching YouTube videos, checking Instagram and others, playing some games, listening to music, writing code, customizing almost everything, and more things I forgot to say…</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-blue" id="faq">Misc</h2>
                <p>It'll look like a FAQ, but it's not really a FAQ, because these questions are not really frequently asked. But why not?</p>
                <h3 class="text-blue">"What the f##k is this English sometimes?"</h3>
                <p>Sorry if my translations are bad, remember that English is not my primary language, and any kind of help of translations are always the welcome!</p>
                <h3 class="text-blue">"When did you start coding? With which language(s)?"</h3>
                <p>I started coding during summer holidays in 2020, with CSS first to make a Discord theme.</p>
                <h3 class="text-blue">"When and why did you start Gacha?"</h3>
                <p>In April 2020, first I wanted to make some OCs with a friend. After, I started my YouTube channel, made some mini movies and I entered in the true community. Currently I am less often on Gacha because I'm busy coding themes and this website. <i>That doesn't mean I'll stop that soon!</i></p>
                <h3 class="text-blue">"What do you do most of the time?"</h3>
                <p>Maybe talking on Discord and writing code and I always listen to music. I often write code to modify Discord, lol.</p>
                <h3 class="text-blue">"Can we become friends?"</h3>
                <p>There are no problem with that, so yes if you want. Also, I know that I'm almost never the first to start a conversation in DMs, if you want to know.</p>
                <h3 class="text-blue">"How do you best describe yourself?"</h3>
                <p>Uuumm, maybe kind, funny and ugly? Without lying, I think once you know me a minimum, you'll describe me better than myself.</p>
                <h3 class="text-blue">"Will you accept me a day to be together in case I love you?"</h3>
                <p>Haha, how can you love me, as a <i>ugly</i> person I am? Anyways, four letters (can be only two): <b>NOPE</b>. I am not open for that, and I'll never be open. <i>But what a weird question…</i></p>

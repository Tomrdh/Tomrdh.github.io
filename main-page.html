                <h1 class="text-green" id="oh-hello">Oh, hello!</h1>
                <p>Hey, welcome to the main page of this website! This website regroups everything (or <i>almost</i> everything…) about me and my stuff.</p>
                <p>I wanted to make an <i>home</i> of this website, because before, only <a href="https://tomrdh.github.io/da-website/main">Discord Addons</a> existed on this domain. It was my first website I made and my first development project, and I still maintain it.</p>
                <h2 class="text-blue">Start visiting!</h2>
                <p>Use the sidebar that you can see at the left to go in other pages. Some external related links are also available.</p>
                <p><i>Also, did you notice that the concept of the navigation system and the UI is inspired by Discord?</i></p>
                <h1 class="text-green" id="news">News</h1>
                <p>Everything new about me and my stuff!</p>
                <h2 class="text-blue">2021-01-05: Primary Discord Server Update: Counters Fix</h2>
                <p>I replaced the stats bot, then, from now on, the counter of bots are no longer false. There are 11 bots in this server, not 3.</p>
                <h2 class="text-blue">2021-01-01: Something… smol, but making things better</h2>
                <p>What's better for a profile picture's appearance than a square? A circle. Now the tab icon has rounded borders. <s><i>I just edited the image with an external image editor and replaced it…</i></s></p>
                <h2 class="text-blue">2020-12-26: This website was released very recently!</h2>
                <p>This is a brand new website with honestly not really any defined goal. I only wanted to make this as my "home" and to continue practising HTML and CSS (maybe later JS - don't worry if you don't understand what does these initials mean, it doesn't matter). This is still a place that you can bookmark if you're interested about my content, it will be often updated, particularly these news. Anyways, enjoy visiting this place!</p>

                <h2 class="text-blue">2020-12-09: That's so nice! I broken my arm…</h2>
                <p>I know some people don't care, but I don't care if you don't care. Yeah, I accidentally broken my left arm (and also my hand/fingers). Since this day, I am sadly less productive, I can't play games that require 2 hands, and if I want to type on my keyboard, I must use something called "StickyKeys" (press 5 times Shift on Windows). Sorry, I can't play Roblox, nor the Nintendo Switch with you right now, if you wanted to. Maybe in some months…? But remember that nothing will prevent you from trying to add me as a friend on any game. I just have to know you a minimum to accept your request.</p>
